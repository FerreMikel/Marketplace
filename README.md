# Marketplace
A marketplace developed with Python 3 and Django as part of Web Engineering subject at University of Deusto
## Project Proposal
The "Marketplace" project implements a web site in which different bikes are classified by type (road bike, mountain bike, touring bike, etc.) and by manufacturer (Orbea, BH, Cannondale, etc.). Each manufacturer will have inside the site its own "mini-marketplace" where their bikes will be shown and classified by type.
